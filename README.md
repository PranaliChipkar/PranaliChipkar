# Hi 👋, I'm Pranali

I'm wrapping up my MS in Computer Software Engineering at Northeastern University and honestly, I'm really excited about where data engineering and healthcare intersect. There's something deeply satisfying about taking messy, complex datasets and turning them into something that actually helps solve real problems especially in healthcare and biotech.

I've spent the past few years building data pipelines, wrangling enterprise and healthcare data, and figuring out how to make infrastructure scale. Whether it's automating bioinformatics workflows at nChroma Bio or managing enterprise systems for 600K+ users at Infosys, I genuinely enjoy the challenge of making data work harder and smarter.

What drives me? Building things that matter. I love collaborating with smart people, asking hard questions, and finding elegant solutions to complicated problems. Currently looking for full-time Data Engineering roles where I can keep doing exactly that.
